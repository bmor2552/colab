# Lets Colab !
When growing your portfolio, it is important to include group projects. In the real world you will be on a team of professionals desiging, engineering, reserching, and launching products/projects. 

For this colaberation I have joined forces with Gunner W. to create a website as well as an Instagram for an upcoming aesthetician Segen T. Below you will find the link to the website design:

We are in the beginning statges of creation, the link will update with each edit we make. 

# About The Client 
For this design the client wants a clean and straight foward website.
In the near future she will be sending us professional pictures. The photographs that you see in the design are place holders. 
**Site Map:**
- Home Page 
- About Section
- Services Section 
- Calendar That Displays Her Availability 
- Policy Section 
- Credentials Section 
- Book An Appointment 
- Pricing Page (seperate from the main landing page)

The client will be using the google voice application along with Instagram to communicate with clients. Clients will also be using Instagram direct messages to book the appointment. This process will change once client is ready.In the near future we will replace this system with an extension or application that allows customers to book an appointment through the website.
